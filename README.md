# Emoji-to-IPv4

IPv4 addresses are 4 bytes long. Emoji are often 4 bytes long too (when encoded
in UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32). It's also possible to have other strings which are
multiples of 4 bytes when encoded. Why not show the equivalent IPv4 address for
a given emoji or other UTF-8 sequence?

This page does that. (As pointless as it is.)
